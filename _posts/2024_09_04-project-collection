At DH2024 in Arlington Virginia, the WoGem lunchtime conversation struck many sparks - including the (re)starting of a Project Collection. Here we'll keep a list of projects that members have done / are doing / think are interesting / would like to start, updated by Sarah Hoover (2024). 
<!-- Read more -->

Do you have a project in mind? Have you recently completed one? Do you need participants, collaborators, or an institutional host? Or have you just heard about something interesting? 

[Use this Google form](https://forms.gle/QGmcsqmi9uGqHMq68) to submit projects for our collection!
Here you can see all the submissions: [DH WoGem Project Collection](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/17_b7Bw8GUwamXDjkQbOmselsIoQNHdjlx3xak6rbtZk/edit?usp=sharing)
