Quinn Dombrowski will host the first DH-WOGEM conversation on February 1, 2019 from 9-10:30 Pacific (11-12:30 Central, 12-1:30 Eastern), on experiences with pregnancy, maternity leave, and going back to work. Potential and future parents are welcome! [If you have a story to share anonymously, please fill out this form!](https://goo.gl/forms/wLo65Bx9xsCdZIQo2).

In this conversation, participants can share experiences about how they made choices (or didn't) about when to become a parent, and what arrangements they worked out around pregnancies, maternity leave, and accommodations (e.g. breastfeeding, daycare drop-off/pick-up, etc.) after returning to work. Potential and future parents are welcome to ask questions!

If you're involved with digital humanities, and have had children at any point in your career, or are interested in hearing the perspectives and advice of people who've already been down that road, please join us! If you can't make it and you have a story you'd like to share anonymously or with attribution, you can [fill out this Google form](https://goo.gl/forms/wLo65Bx9xsCdZIQo2). 

Even if you can't make it to the conversation, we welcome collaborators on an "artifact" of some form (white paper, etc.) that will be written by a smaller group of participants after the conversation. If you'd like to be involved with putting this document together, please email Quinn at qad@stanford.edu.
